SITK-IBEX,"Software for aligning/registering images acquired with the IBEX microscopy imaging technique. This Python package enables alignment of multiple cycles of fluorescence images, acquired using IBEX. A repeated marker is used to register all panels to a selected panel (in the registration nomenclature this is the fixed image). After registration all panels are resampled onto the fixed image.

While this method was developed for a specific imaging protocol, it will likely work for other  protocols that contain a repeated marker. The registration approach is implemented using the [SimpleITK](https://www.simpleitk.org) toolkit registration framework.

The key implementation aspects include:

1. Multi-phase based approach with robust initialization.
2. Multi-resolution and point sampling.
3. Affine transformation model.
4. Use of correlation as optimized similarity metric.",2020,https://pypi.org/project/sitkibex/,https://github.com/niaid/sitk-ibex,Python,Apache-2.0,10.1073/pnas.2018488117
